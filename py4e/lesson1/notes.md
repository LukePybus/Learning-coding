- I made a github account
- I created the repositry called 'Learning-coding'
- I then configured code-server
- I edited the readme and committed to the repositry
- I then created an account on py4e and started the lessons
- I then looked and spoke to my dad about ways of running code
- Spoke about text editors and IDE's
- Showed running python code-server
- The last thing we did was a test and ran 'Hello world' in a python script
